## 🧠 Project Overview
This project explores **global and Israeli internet quality and usage trends** using data from **Cloudflare Radar (Jan 2024 – Jun 2025)**.  
It includes two interactive Tableau dashboards that analyze how Israel compares to the rest of the world across performance, accessibility, and browser behavior.

## 📈 Dashboards
### 1️⃣ Internet Usage & Browser Trends
- Analysis of browser usage across countries (Chrome, Safari, etc.)
- Desktop vs. Mobile usage distribution
- Global browser popularity trends over time
- Visualizations: Choropleth Maps, Bar Charts, Line Charts, Sankey Diagram, Heatmaps

### 2️⃣ Internet Quality Index (IQI)
- Focus on **Latency**, **Bandwidth**, and **DNS** metrics
- Monthly data comparison for each country (2024–2025)
- Israel’s relative ranking vs. Top 10 global countries
- Visualizations: KPI cards, Time Series, Scatter Plots, Country Comparisons
